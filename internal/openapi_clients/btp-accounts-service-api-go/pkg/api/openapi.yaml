  description: "The Accounts service provides REST APIs that are responsible for the\
    \ management of global accounts, and the creation and management of directories,\
    \ subaccounts, and their custom properties/tags. \nGlobal accounts represent a\
    \ business entity and contain contract information, including customer details\
    \ and purchased entitlements. The global account is the context for billing each\
    \ customer. \nUse the subaccount APIs to structure your global account according\
    \ to your organization's and project's requirements regarding members, authorizations,\
    \ and quotas. This service also provides you with APIs for creating and managing\
    \ directories. While the use of directories is optional, they allow you to further\
    \ organize and manage your subaccounts according to your specific technical and\
    \ business needs. The service also lets you manage the custom properties/tags\
    \ that you associate with your directories and subaccounts.\nNOTE: These APIs\
    \ are relevant only for cloud management tools feature set B. For details and\
    \ information about whether this applies to your global account, see [Cloud Management\

        Directories allow you to organize and manage your subaccounts according to your technical and business needs.
        A directory can contain one or more subaccounts and directories. The maximum number of directory levels allowed in a global account is 5.
        Using directories to group subaccounts is optional.
        If you have directories in your account model, you can still create subaccounts directly under your global account.

    patch:
      description: |-
        Global account admins can enable additional features in a directory or remove features that are already enabled.

        By default, all directories provide the following basic features: (1) group and filter subaccounts, (2) monitor usage and costs, and (3) set custom properties and tags. Optionally, you can allow a directory to also manage its own entitlements and its user authorizations.

        All existing subaccounts and subdirectories in the directory implicitly inherit the capabilities of the enabled features in this directory.

        NOTE: The user authorizations management feature must be applied in combination with the entitlement management feature. In other words, if the directory has both entitlement and user authorization management enable, you cannot disable just the entitlement management feature without also disabling user authorization management. Likewise, if a directory has only the default features enabled, you cannot enable user authorization management without also enabling entitlement management.

        NOTE: Your multi-level account hierarchy can have more than one directory enabled with user authorization and/or entitlement management; however, only one directory in any directory path can have these features enabled. In other words, other directories above or below this directory in the same path can only have the default features specified. If you are not sure which features to enable, we recommend that you set only the default features, and then add features later on as they are needed.

        Use this API to create a service instance and associated bindings for a specified subaccount to get credentials to access Service Manager APIs.<br><br> We create this instance and bindings for you directly in your subaccount, and as such, they are not associated with or restricted to any specific environment.<br> The instance created with this API has a generic name:<br> - ServiceManagementAccessInstance<br><br> You can create more than one binding associated with the created service instance.<br> This has many benefits, for example if you need to use credentials rotation.<br><br>There are two types of service bindings you can create, depending on the credentials type:<br> - Binding with Basic credentials<br> - Binding with mTLS credentials<br><br> The binding with Basic credentials is a default type that you get without specifying any parameters in the *CreateServiceManagerBindingRequestPayload* object. If you wish to use the mTLS type, specify parameters.<br> For example: {
         "credential-type": "x509",
         "x509": {
         "key-length": 2048,
         "validity": 7,
         "validity-type": "DAYS"
         }

          **Tip**
         To view the created instance and bindings, use the *GET /accounts/accounts/v2/subaccounts/{subaccountGUID}/serviceManagerBindings/{bindingName}* API.<br/><br/>Required scope: $XSAPPNAME.global-account.subaccount.update
